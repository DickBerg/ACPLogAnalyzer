                <h3>Release Notes</h3>
            <div>		<p><strong>Version 1.36 (7 April 2018)</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Log Format Addition:</strong><br />
                        Only change is to fix a log error when "repeat" targets are imaged. Previously this caused 
												ACPLogAnalyzer to think each "repeat" was a new Target and not correctly report statistics.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>

                        <strong>Migration:</strong><br />
                        Corrections to allow reinstall of the program. Note, I have noticed some
                        error when the program is automatically downloaded by ACPLogAnalyzer. It may
                        not allow the program to download before trying to install the file.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Support for All-Sky plate solves (new in ACP 7)</strong><br/>
                    Added support for the new all-sky plate solve feature added in ACP 7. <br/>
                    New reporting and graphing features introduced as follows:
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Report on overall count of successful all-sky plate solves</li>
                        <li>Report on overall count of unsuccessful all-sky plate solves</li>
                        <li>Report on per-target count of successful all-sky plate solves</li>
                        <li>Report on per-target count of unsuccessful all-sky plate solves</li>
                        <li>Plot of all-sky plate solve times for the current log</li>
                        <li>Plot of average times for successful all-sky plate solves for all logs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    Adjusted log parsing logic so that:
                    <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pointing errors during the all-sky pate solve process are ignored (because they are unrepresentative)</li>
                        <li>Pointing errors immediately following a successful all-sky pate solve are inlcuded</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    Application preference settings to include/exclude the new reporting options have been added to the Configure Report window
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Moved source to Visual Studio 2012</strong><br/>
                    This has no impact on application features
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>New installer</strong><br/>
                    Forced to introduce a new third-party (InstallShield 2012 LE) installer as Visual Studio 2012 no longer provides setup projects
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Code clean-up</strong><br/>
                    Many changes to clean-up and standardize code (following inspection and code analysis with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">ReSharper</a>).
                    This has no impact on application features
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed a bug where attempting to select a 'non-selectable' graph plot option caused subsequent valid selections not to output a valid graph
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Minor changes to Auto-Update logic</strong><br/>
                    The auto-update feature now downloads updates to the user's Desktop (previously it was a hard-to-find temporary folder)
                </li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <p><strong>Version 1.31 (05 April 2012)</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed a bug where clicking the 'Add Single Log' button without having previously selected a path caused the application to stop responding
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed a system-wide bug related to the timing of operations which spanned the midnight 'time-flip'. This resulted in the time-span for some operations
                    being assigned a negative value
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed a bug where the text report was showing total imaging time, rather than the individual imaging target totals
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Deployment server change</strong><br/>
                    Made changes to reflect the fact that the application is now served from http://www.rarcher.net
                </li>
                <p></p>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Version 1.30 (13 February 2012)</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed an issue where some measurements (e.g. guider settle time) that happen instantly (take zero seconds to complete) were
                    not being recorded for either text reports or graphs. Such measurements are now being correctly reported and graphed
                </li>
                <p></p>

            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <p><strong>Version 1.29 (07 December 2011)</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bug fix:</strong><br/>
                    Fixed minor issue with <em>Slew (to target) time</em>. We now ignore rare instances where the slew starts but
                    ACP doesn't report the slew end time. These instances are detected by looking for pointing updates, re-slews to targets
                    or starting slews to other targets
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Internal code refactoring:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Split the Log class into a partial class, spread over two files (the log parsing methods were split out)</li>
                        <li>Split the ParseLog() method so that each log event's processing was refactored into distinct methods (was in one large method)</li>
                        <li>Reworked all the average, sum, etc. type methods/getters to use the built-in .NET Average, Sum, etc. extension methods</li>
                        <li>Refactored enumerations of properties where possible with LINQ expressions</li>
                        <li>Refactored log properties to use on-demand calculated values (previously used cached private members exposed by getters)</li>
                        <li>Refactored report, again by using LINQ to query log data and eliminate duplicated data</li>
                        <li>Numerous other changes to clean, simplify and improve code quality</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Clicking on a graph data-point now scrolls the log</strong><br/>
                    Clicking on any data-point (except the average line) scrolls the log contents window to highlight
                    the relevant event in the log. This only works for "currently selected log" graphs

                <li>
                    <strong>FWHM v HFD graphs now have two independent axes</strong><br/>
                    FWHM v HFD comparision graphs now show the two data sets on independent (overlaid) axes. This means that both FWHM and HFD
                    data points now show the correct dates/times
                </li>
                <p></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed issue where the text report average HFD values were being wrongly calculated</li>
                        <li>Fixed a caching issue with release notes displayed in the Update and Help windows</li>

                    <strong>Replaced graph 'show average' checkbox with right-click option</strong><br/>
                    Removed the 'show average' checkbox from the graph window and replaced it with a right-click option
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>FWHM measurements now ignore pointing updates</strong><br/>
                    FWHM measurements now only include data for successful plate-solves on imaging targets (e.g. pointing update FWHM's are ignored)
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Added HFD measurements</strong><br/>
                    Added reporting of HFD measurements (as reported by FocusMax) for both the selected log and for all logs.
                    If an auto-focus run fails, the measurement is disgarded
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Added graphs for HFD values</strong><br/>
                    Added two new graphs to show HFD values for the selected log, and average HFD values for all logs

                <li>
                    <strong>Added graphs for FWHM v HFD</strong><br/>
                    Added two new graphs to compare FWHM and HFD. Note that to facilitate easier comparision, the HFD data is fitted
                    to the timescale used by the FWHM data (i.e. the HFD datapoints are not shown at their 'correct' times)
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Added configuration tab for third data series</strong><br/>
                    Added a new tab to the graph configuration window to allow properties to be set for the tertiary data series (currently only
                    used when comparing FWHM and HFD)

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bug fix</strong>: Graph plots would fail if no selection was made, then an overall (no graph selection needed) graph type was selected for plot (fixed)</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>Versioning</strong><br/>
                    Change to version numbering scheme. Now use the format n.nn (from n.n)</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Graph bug fix</strong><br/>
                    Fixed bug where the Average Pointing Error (center slew) and Average Pointing Error (object slew) graphs were using the same graph definition
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Parsing engine updates</strong><br/>
                    Major improvements to the way the following events are parsed (this follows a review by Jim McMillan (thank you!) of all the
                    rules used by the log parser):
                    <p></p>

                        <li>Filter change time</li>
                        <li>Autoguider failure (unguided imaging)</li>

                <p></p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Other changes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzer remembers the last directory used when opening logs</li>
                        <li>Renamed 'Guider Failure' feature to 'Guider Failure/Unguided Imaging'</li>
                        <li>Bug: Average Pointing Error (center slew) and Average Pointing Error (object slew) were using the same graph def (fixed)</li>
                        <li>Graphs are now plotted on a background thread, improving responsiveness of the UI during lengthy processing</li>
                        <li>The user can now minimize the main window</li>
                        <li>Bug: Unsuccessful AF count was not working correctly (fixed)</li>
